### VPython-repos
### This is my code to complete the assignment for Paul McWhorter's Less7 Arduino with Python
### Lesson Homework is to make a vpython visual representation of information received from Arudino and sensors
### There are two sets of code, one for Arduino(Uno), the other for Python (with vpython installed)
### Demonstration Video can be viewed at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2hjVZEAtiA
### In order to work properly, this project needs an Arduino Uno or (legal)match with:
### a potentiometer of 1kohms connected to 5v, Analogpin A0, Grnd
### A DHT11 (or better) temp/humidity sensor is connected to digital pin 2, 3.3v, Grnd
